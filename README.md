# Simple AMM

Forked from flux's fork of AiTechEye's smartshop, this simple Automated Market Maker uses the
existing smartshopinterface but adjusts prices automatically.  Your shop uses its inventory to
function as both buyer and seller, adjusting prices upward as demand rises and downward as it falls.

Version: Redo 20210220.0

This is a successor to the existing smartshop mod, that fixes numerous issues and gripes.
It is possible to update existing installations of the smartshop mod to this version.
However, the API has changed significantly, so any mod that depended on smartshop in the
past will probably need to be updated. There is no easy way to revert to the old version,
so please test thoroughly before installing this on a live server. 

More documentation is on the TODO list. Please be patient.
